## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Inside Airbnb data on Chicago to answer several questions:

    What are the most and least expensive neighborhoods?
    Do small businesses have better ratings than hosts with a single property?
    Can we predict price from other features?

## File Descriptions

There is a csv file of data obtained from Inside Airbnb at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and one notebooks of my work.

## Results

The main findings of the code are as follows:

    The most expensive neighborhoods tend to be centrally located or have a lot of "hot" restaurants and nightlife.  The least expensive ones are all on the South and West Sides, areas of the city that have higher crime rates.
    There is no discernible difference in ratings based on the number of properties a host has listed on Airbnb.
    The model I developed was not effective in predicting rental prices, but that could probably be corrected with additional analysis.
