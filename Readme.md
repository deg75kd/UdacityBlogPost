## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Inside Airbnb data on Chicago to answer several questions:

    What are the most and least expensive neighborhoods?
    Do small businesses have better ratings than hosts with a single property?
    Can we predict price from other features?

## File Descriptions

There is a csv file of data obtained from Inside Airbnb at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html and one notebooks of my work.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at https://medium.com/@kevin.dejesus/opportunities-for-airbnb-hosts-in-chicago-c2e68fea5c0f.
